# Operating Systems Project - Linux Command "mbob it"
by Cristalina Nguyen, Christian Santander, Liam Namba

Project for Operating Systems at Loyola Marymount University

## Description


## Rationale
Why this is a good idea, or what the good points of it are


## 1.3 – List of Linux modules that will be modified/affected
"mv" - command that moves one or more files or directories from one place to another where the file content is copied to the new location and the old file is removed. However if both filenames are on the same filesystem, "mv" results in a simple file rename.
"ls" - command that lists computer files where when invoked without any arguments, ls lists the files in the current working directory.


# 1.4 – Preliminary list of any new modules that you will produce [or 'Not Applicable' if there are none]
