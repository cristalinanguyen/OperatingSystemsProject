CMSI 387 Operating Systems
	Semester Project
===================================

OMG, this is VERY cute!  I like the idea as a novelty.  It might
also have implications for security, if any of you are interested
in that direction.  For example, having a command to randomize
the case of the file names might make things hard for some users
when they can't find their files.  However, in Linux there is
the "find" command which has a switch to "ignore case" so they
would probably be able to locate it again.

A very good novelty project, and one that will definitely give
you guys and gal experience with the O/S.

Project approved.  Good work and good luck!
